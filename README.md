# 5NaNs
5NaNs, exactly as it sounds when you try to pronounce it, is a React application that can used for managing your finances, and ensuring that all your numbers are right and on point, and you don't end up with **NaNs** in your hands (which have **5** fingers. Coincidence? No. Clever pun).

5NaNs requires users to login using a Google account based authentication system, and provides a platform using which users can add, edit, remove, and track their expenses, with ease.
